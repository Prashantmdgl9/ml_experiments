This repo is for the Machine Learning portfolio that I have created at the address below. <br>

These experiments, codes, exercises, scribbles have been created in order to understand a concept and to crystallise my understanding on how things work in the filed of deep learning. 

I started working in the field of natural language processing in the year 2009-2010 when data science wasn't even a field perse in the popular opinion. Later I was put in a team that focused on oeprations research i.e. essentially creating optimization algorithms for a multi million dollar marketing analytics platform that was designed in house and saw a wide gamut of clients including many fortune 100 and 500 ones.

From late 2015 onwards, I moved into the predictive analytics field and carried out very small projects, meanwhile boosting my learning through kaggle kernels and from my peers; and since then I have ben dabbling in machine learning and deep learning.
