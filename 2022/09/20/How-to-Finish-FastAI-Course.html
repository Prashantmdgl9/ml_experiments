<ol>
  <li>Start from Lesson 1, watch the video, finish the exercise to get a taste of the APIs.<br /></li>
  <li>Continue with the rest of the lessons. Make sure you finish the questionnaire, you can leave the further research questions for the time being.<br /></li>
  <li>If you are stuck, then try to find solutions but don’t stay there too long.<br /></li>
  <li>Lesson which talks about Neural Net foundations is an important one, and the one where you build SGD and a few other models from scratch. Spend extra time on them, a week isn’t a bad idea.<br /></li>
  <li>Run all the notebooks yourself to see the outputs and understand what it happening, if you don’t understand something then refer the various resources.<br /></li>
  <li>If there are additional resources used in the lesson such as excel sheets, they will be available on the repo, always replicate them, excel is a great way to learn things from basics on small examples.<br /></li>
  <li>Once you are in the middle of the course, take a gander of the things and write a couple of blog pieces to crystallise your understanding. They can be on any topics of your choice.<br /></li>
  <li>It’s always a good idea to re run the notebooks and then run them again on a dataset of your choice and see if you can get the good levels of accuracy and if not then what are the hurdles.<br /></li>
  <li>Finish all the lessons at least once. Finishing something entirely gives you a psychological advantage.<br /></li>
  <li>Before wrapping up, go through all the questionnaires from all the lessons and find all the tech papers that were discussed in the lessons.<br />
<br />
You are done for 2 weeks.
<br />
<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>After 2 weeks of break, go back to the lessons, from 1 o 2, whatever you prefer and rewatch at 1.5x speed or whatever you prefer. This time take a stab at all the further research questions.
<br />
<br /></p>

<p>The things to focus in this iteration:
<br /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Further research questions <br /></li>
  <li>In every lesson there is a central idea, such as SGD from scratch, neural net from scratch, design your own grad etc, try to implement them without taking external help.<br /></li>
  <li>Fill any gaps in understanding of the subject matter through primary and secondary research.<br />
<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>After or during the first iteration, if there is an idea forming on a particular problem statement that you want to solve then start working in that direction.
<br />
Whatever you have learned in these 2 iterations, apply them on your problem statement. Try to finish it fromend to end i.e after finishing it, deploy it or productify it and write an extensive blogpost about it.</p>
