<h1 id="boosting">Boosting</h1>

<p>Boosting in another method of creating a strong learner from various weak learners.
<br />
It is a sequential method in which the learners are created in a sequential manner and the errors/misclassifications from the previous model/learner
are given a higher weight to be included in sample that will be selected for training the next learner/model.<br />
This goes on till a condition is met such as batch size or the time reached.<br />
The result of all the learners is combined together(not averaged as it is done in Bagging) and the sum is considered the prediction.</p>
